what problem does this concept solve?

where can i see this in action?

where can i learn more about this concept?
show a list of all the links with a little explanation of what's in the link.
also show the level of the content(beginner, intermediate, advanced)
maybe make a list of ALL the links in a yaml file
and add tags to those links?


think about a concept page
a page dedicated to one-single-concept


look at the 5-level layering:

field \ book \ part \ chapter \ sub-topic

pre-hacking \ operating-systems \ part-2 \ synchronization-tools \ mutex-locks

is this how you want to organize?

how do you want to implement each layer in jekyll?
maybe as a collection?
and their links as yaml data?
let's try that!
