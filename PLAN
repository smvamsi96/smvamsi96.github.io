ValueCreation:
	-people should know what resources are available for them on the web( only the best )
	-for any skill( mostly computers )
	-should be able to know where they are in the process ( A RoadMap )
	-they don't need to scour and scrape the web like a maniac

Marketing:
	-haven't figured this out yet
	-whose help should I get?

Sales:
	-haven't figured this out yet

ValueDelivery:
	-faster loading speeds( keep the site static )
	-should give a "quality" feel
	-easy UI
	-you should provide a way for people to give feedback and contribute to the site
	-should it be open-source?

Finance:
	-My Business Model is Audience-Aggregation
	-There is an inefficiency in the market for resource aggregation( that's google, by the way )
	-Always ask yourself is this worth the effort you're putting into making this site



The Loop:

1. Start with a lame version
2. Make it better( using feedback or other methods )
3. Make the Loop better too



Pointers:
	-You need to classify topics and subclassify
